here's a link to the last dataset I build - I took 6000 photos in the following manner:
from 4 species from my family's garden I picked ~10 plants from each species and took ~10 photos on 10 backgrounds,
together 4 * 10 * 10 * 10 photos, same stuff with 2 plants belonging to two distinct species at home (2000 photos) - as trees currently mostly do not have developed leaves, 
I thought it may be practical to test AI on such "leaves" before we move on to trees
I used this dataset on most-basic AI model from most-introductory Tensorflow tutorial and got really promising results
(I've got original photos locally with resolution 4122x3096, those on Google Drive were resized into 400x300)

here's link to a test-testset, I took ~380  photos of four tree species to have something concrete to work on with coding attempts
(hope that link works)
